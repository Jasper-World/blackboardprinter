# blackboardprinter
Base on Lego EV3 program, working for blackboard, it printer in blackboard draw what do you want.

I use some H bean and other parts to make the car move and use two turbine assembly to allowed the mechanical arm to flex and print, one is the arm that con go up and down the other is at the end of the mechanical arm and it can move back and forth.

#how it work: 
1. I put the robot's tire on the blackboard every 10 degrees to move the car forward.
2. I used the roudpach variarable to store my progress so that when the car returned,it will axactly where the car start.

3.first I mark the word "中国" in the excel I set 2100 points and the robot will print it like a little dot on the paper like the one on the picture
4.with the helping of program software of lego EV3 it can read 2100 the information of each point will be notified to the chalk at the end of the mechanical arm when it reaches the position where the mark is printed.
